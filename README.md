# Skyrim Ingredient Effect Matcher

This is a program I created for the video game Skyrim. The program matches ingredients based on their shared ingredient effects.

Purpose: Prints which ingredients already work with the target ingredient. 

Reason: This saves time when trying new combinations of ingredients because known combinations and unknown combinations are labeled the same.

## Set-Up Instructions
1. Open Skyrim.
2. Place all the ingredients you want to test in your inventory.
3. Interact with an Alchemy table.
4. Make sure the 'Ingredients' tab on the left column is the selected tab.
5. Hover your mouse over an ingredient on the right column.

6. Execute the program!
